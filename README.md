# CodeSteez
My personal blog! Here I write short articles about my projects, things that interest me, and everything else related to computing. 
[Visit my site](https://www.codesteez.com/)

## Built with
[React](https://reactjs.org/) - A declarative, component based UI framework thats super efficient with its use of virtual dom.

[Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - A superset of Javascript that forces static typing.

[ButterCMS](https://buttercms.com/) - Headless content management system that I use to write and store my blog posts.

[EmailJS](https://www.emailjs.com/) - A Javascript library that connects to email services so users can send me personalized messages.

[ReCaptcha](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/intro/v3.html) - Filters out bots from sending me spam emails.

[Flexbox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout/Basic_Concepts_of_Flexbox) - Highly compatible CSS properties.

[SASS](https://sass-lang.com/) - A CSS preprocessor that makes styling my site more organized.

[Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) - A cloud platform that I use to host my site.

## Goals
I wanted to build a professional website while only having to focus on writing a front-end codebase. As a result, I opted to use ButterCMS so I wouldn't have to manage any server side code for storing my blog posts. In the same vain, I chose to use EmailJS so I wouldn't have to work with any server side code or SMTP to send emails. I also wanted my CSS styling to be compatible with the most browsers possible, which led me to using Flexbox. Flexbox supports 95% of all modern web browsers. CSS Modules were also used so I could style each component individually, and SASS made organizing my CSS much easier. Typescript makes using React a much more pleasurable experience because forces static typing in your application. Static typing comes at a cost, though it is well worth it because Javascript lacks meaningful error messages. This is all deployed to heroku, which makes efficient use of dinos which are perfect for small applications.

## TODOs
Light theme / Dark theme toggle so my viewers don't burn their eyes at night

Theme should be persisted in local storage
